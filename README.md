# Twiiter_Sentiment_Analysis
This was a challenge in Siraj Raval's video of Learn Python for Data Science -#2 Video Series. 

The code uses the tweepy library to access the Twitter API and the TextBlob library to perform Sentiment Analysis on each Tweet. We'll be able to see how positive or negative each tweet is about whatever topic we choose.

##Challenge

Instead of printing out each tweet, I had to save each Tweet to a CSV file with an associated label. The label should be either 'Positive' or 'Negative'. I defined the sentiment polarity threshold myself, whatever I thought constituted a tweet being positive/negative.
